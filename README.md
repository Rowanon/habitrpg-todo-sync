HabitRPG Todo Synchronization
=============================

This is a quick-and-dirty tool (currently planned to be a command line-only tool) to get Remember the Milk tasks into HabitRPG and track updates to both each time it's run. It isn't intended to be feature-complete, useful for everyone, or robust. But it is intended to work.

Installation
============

I don't know yet. Clone it and run `npm install`, then `./main.js`. That works at least.

Roadmap
=======

I hope this kind of functionality makes it into HabitRPG itself. This is intended as a stopgap, but if people like it, maybe I'll work on it more. Maybe. Civilized requests will get infinitely more attention than entitled flaming.

Complaining about the license is fine. Since it's free, I figured it ought to stay that way even if worked on by others. Give me some compelling reasons, and I'll consider relicensing.

Legal
=====
Remember the Milk wants me to tell you that: "This product uses the Remember The Milk API but is not endorsed or certified by Remember The Milk." So take heed.
